# Session Checkpoint - 2025-11-15 15:00

## Status

**Branch**: main
**Context**: Building Claude Workflow Pro plugin - generalizing commands from Golden Paws Photography
**Phase**: Phase 3 - GitHub & Development Commands (partially complete)

## What's Done

### Phase 1: Repository Setup ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ Plugin manifest created (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`)
- ✅ Directory structure in place (`commands/workflow`, `commands/development`, `commands/github`, `commands/research`)

### Phase 2: Core Workflow Commands ✅ COMPLETE
- ✅ `checkpoint.md` - reviewed and verified generalized
- ✅ `resume-work.md` - reviewed and verified generalized
- ✅ `validate-plan.md` - reviewed and verified generalized
- ✅ `create-plan.md` - newly created from Golden Paws source
- ✅ `implement-plan.md` - newly created from Golden Paws source
- ✅ `init.md` - newly created from Golden Paws source

### Phase 3: GitHub & Development Commands - IN PROGRESS (4/9 complete)

**Completed:**
- ✅ `commands/development/commit.md` - generalized
- ✅ `commands/development/debug.md` - generalized
- ✅ `commands/development/local-review.md` - generalized
- ✅ `commands/research/research-codebase.md` - generalized

**Remaining (5 commands):**
- ❌ `start-from-issue.md` - GitHub integration (376 lines)
- ❌ `create-issue.md` - Issue creation
- ❌ `setup-github-issues.md` - GitHub setup (516 lines - largest)
- ❌ `describe-pr.md` - PR descriptions
- ❌ `next-task.md` - Task prioritization

## What's Next

**Immediate next step**: Complete Phase 3 by creating the remaining 5 GitHub commands

**Remaining tasks for Phase 3**:

1. Create `commands/github/start-from-issue.md`
   - Read from: `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/start-from-issue.md`
   - Remove "Golden Paws" references
   - Generalize path detection
   - Make progressive discovery generic

2. Create `commands/github/create-issue.md`
   - Read from: `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/create-issue.md`
   - Generalize issue templates
   - Remove project-specific labels

3. Create `commands/github/setup-github-issues.md`
   - Read from: `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/setup-github-issues.md`
   - Make label set configurable
   - Remove Golden Paws-specific labels

4. Create `commands/github/describe-pr.md`
   - Read from: `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/describe-pr.md`
   - Make PR template detection generic
   - Generalize verification steps

5. Create `commands/github/next-task.md`
   - Read from: `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/next-task.md`
   - Make prioritization configurable
   - Remove project-specific criteria

## Key Files

### Created Files (New in this session)

Commands created:
- `commands/workflow/create-plan.md` - 14.6KB, comprehensive planning command
- `commands/workflow/implement-plan.md` - 5.7KB, TDD implementation workflow
- `commands/workflow/init.md` - 6.2KB, project initialization
- `commands/development/commit.md` - 2.2KB, git commit helper
- `commands/development/debug.md` - 5.5KB, debugging framework
- `commands/development/local-review.md` - 2.8KB, git worktree review setup
- `commands/research/research-codebase.md` - 11.5KB, comprehensive research workflow

### Important Files for Context

Source reference:
- `~/Documents/golden-paws-photography/.claude/commands/` - Original commands to generalize from

Planning documents:
- `docs/implementation-plans/2025-11-15-claude-workflow-plugin-tasks.md` - Complete task checklist (184 tasks)
- `docs/implementation-plans/2025-11-15-claude-workflow-plugin.md` - Implementation plan overview
- `docs/implementation-plans/2025-11-15-claude-workflow-plugin-context.md` - Context document

## Key Decisions

1. **Config Detection Pattern**: All commands use this pattern:
   ```bash
   # Check .claude-plugin-config.json first
   # Fall back to .claude/config.json
   # Fall back to auto-detection
   # Fall back to sensible defaults
   ```

2. **Directory Structure**:
   - Organized commands by category: `workflow/`, `development/`, `github/`, `research/`
   - Makes plugin more navigable and maintainable

3. **Generalization Strategy**:
   - Remove all "Golden Paws", "PR #7", "feature/booking-flow" references
   - Make all paths configurable
   - Support both `.claude-plugin-config.json` and `.claude/config.json`
   - Provide sensible defaults when no config exists

4. **No Project-Specific References**: Verified with `grep -r "Golden Paws"` - none found

## Blockers/Issues

None - workflow is smooth. Context at 66% before checkpoint, good time to clear.

## Notes

- All Phase 2 commands verified to have no project-specific references
- Config detection pattern is consistent across all commands
- Source material is high quality - minimal changes needed for generalization
- Average command size: 3-7KB, with research-codebase being largest at 11.5KB
- Task checklist shows 14 phases total, currently on Phase 3

## To Resume

1. Read this checkpoint file
2. Continue with Phase 3 - create remaining 5 GitHub commands:
   - `start-from-issue.md`
   - `create-issue.md`
   - `setup-github-issues.md`
   - `describe-pr.md`
   - `next-task.md`
3. After Phase 3 complete, move to Phase 4: Copy & Adapt Agents (10 agent files)
4. Reference the task checklist at `docs/implementation-plans/2025-11-15-claude-workflow-plugin-tasks.md` for full roadmap
